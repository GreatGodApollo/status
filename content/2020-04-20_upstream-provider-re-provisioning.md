Due to Endless Hosting's upstream provider needing to re-provision, many web services are down. This includes my primary website and nearly all subdomains. Because of this outage the Discord bot's database may not be able to connect.

### Updates
* Closing incident as issues are mostly resolved
* Currently there is at least 80% of the global network seeing the IP block, incident is currently still open, though most services are alive
* You can check the routing status of the ASN [here](https://stat.ripe.net/185.86.231.0%20-%20185.86.231.255?sourceapp=ripedb#tabId=routing)
